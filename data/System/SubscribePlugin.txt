---+ Subscribe Plugin

<!--
   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = %$SHORTDESCRIPTION%
-->
%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

Example (only works if plugin is installed, and you are logged in - you are: %WIKIUSERNAME% (not %MAINWEB%.WikiGuest)): %SUBSCRIBE%

---++ Usage
%INCLUDE{"VarSUBSCRIBE" section="subscribe_attributes"}%

%X%Note: This subscribe macro is for adding and removing individual subscriptions.  It is not aware of subscriptions due to membership in a subscribed group.  If a user is subscribed to a topic due to group membership,  the subscribe link will show the user as subscribed,
but clicking it will *not* unsubscribe the individual user.  If a user wishes to unsubscribe as an exception, manually add a "negative subscription" to the WebNotify topic.  Ex:  If !JoeUser is a member of !SomeGroup,
then the user can unsubscribe manually:
<noautolink>
   * Main.SomeGroup : *
   * Main.JoeUser : - UndesiredTopic
</noautolink>

---++ Access Controls
The guest user is not allowed to subscribe for notification.

You don't need =VIEW= access to the WebNotify topic in order to subscribe to changes in a web, but you must have =CHANGE= access. If you want users to be able to subscribe or unsubscribe, but you don't want them to be able to modify their subscription or otherwise edit the WebNotify topic, you can restrict =VIEW= access to WebNotify. This will make it uneditable from the browser (but will not block =save= urls, so is not fully secure).

%X% Note that permissions on individual topics are *not* checked when subscription mails are sent out, so be very careful about who you allow to subscribe.

---++ Configuration

This plugin has been found to be extremely costly when processing highly
complex WebNotify topics.  However in most environments, its not an issue.

If you wish to limit the plugin to one or more webs, specifiy the list of Active Webs in one of the following ways.   This list is a comma-separates list of Web names.  A "Regular-expression" style wildcard can be used.  For
example: =Main,Sandbox.*= would permit the Main web, Sandbox, including subwebs of Sandbox, or any web prefixed with Sandbox.

   * [[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%#SubscribePlugin$Extensions][configure -> Extensions -> SubscribePlugin]]
      * ={Plugins}{SubscribePlugin}{ActiveWebs} = "Main,Sandbox.*=
   * As a standard preference setting, set in Main.SitePreferences or individual WebPreferences topics.
      * =Set SUBSCRIBEPLUGIN_ACTIVEWEBS = Main,Sandbox.*=

The configure setting takes precedence over the topic based preference setting.
